The solution involves implementing the `keyExtractor` prop within the `FlatList` component. This prop requires a function that returns a unique key for each item in the dataset.  This unique key enables React Native to efficiently identify and recycle list items, resulting in significant performance improvements.

```javascript
//Correct Implementation
<FlatList
  data={myLargeDataset}
  keyExtractor={(item, index) => item.id.toString() || index.toString()}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <MyComponent item={item} />}
/>

```

This corrected implementation uses the `item.id` as the unique key. If your data doesn't have a unique `id`, using the `index` as a fallback ensures uniqueness, although ideally, each data item should have its own unique identifier.
