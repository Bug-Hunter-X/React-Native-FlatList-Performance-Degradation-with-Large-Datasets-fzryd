This bug occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with a large dataset and the `keyExtractor` prop is not correctly implemented or is missing.  The issue manifests as slow rendering, performance issues, and potential crashes.  The problem stems from React Native's inability to efficiently update and recycle list items without unique keys.  Without correct keys, React Native struggles to identify which items have changed, leading to unnecessary re-renders and performance degradation.

```javascript
//Incorrect implementation
<FlatList
  data={myLargeDataset}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <MyComponent item={item} />}
/>

```
